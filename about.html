                        <h2>Susanto Liman</h2>
                        <div class="ceo-story">
                            <p>The story of MR.COFFEE begins with Susanto Liman, a passionate coffee enthusiast with a dream. Born into a family of tea merchants, Susanto's journey into the world of coffee was an unexpected one. During his college years, he discovered the transformative power of a well-crafted cup of coffee and the community that formed around it.</p>
                            
                            <p>After graduating with a business degree, Susanto spent five years traveling to coffee-growing regions around the world—from the mountains of Colombia to the highlands of Ethiopia. He learned from local farmers about sustainable growing practices and the art of bean selection.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 2015, Susanto returned home with a vision: to create a coffee shop that would serve as more than just a place to grab caffeine. He wanted to build a community hub where the coffee was exceptional, the atmosphere was welcoming, and every customer felt like they belonged.</p>
                            
                            <p>With his savings and a small loan, Susanto opened the first MR.COFFEE in a tiny storefront with mismatched furniture and a single espresso machine. What the shop lacked in size, it made up for in character and quality. Word spread quickly about the exceptional coffee and the warm, creative atmosphere.</p>
                            
                            <p>Today, as CEO of MR.COFFEE, Susanto remains hands-on in the business, often found chatting with customers or training new baristas. His commitment to quality, community, and creativity continues to be the guiding principles behind everything MR.COFFEE does.</p>
